# Nunito Font Project
by Vernon Adams

Nunito is a well balanced Sans Serif with rounded terminals. Nunito has been designed mainly to be used as a display font but is useable as a text font too. Nunito has been designed to be used freely across the internet by web browsers on desktop computers, laptops and mobile devices.

In November 2017 Nunito has been expanded to GF Cyrillic Pro by Manvel Shmavonyan, and Alexei Vanyashin.
