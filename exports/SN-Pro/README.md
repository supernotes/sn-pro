# SN Pro Font Famiy

A new professional rounded font, perfect for a variety of different applications. SN Pro is a well balanced Sans Serif with rounded terminals. SN Pro has been designed mainly to be used as a display font but is useable as a text font too. SN Pro has been designed to be used freely across the internet by web browsers on desktop computers, laptops and mobile devices.

'SN' stands for... Supernotes – the note-taking app this was designed for; and “Super” Nunito – the open-source font this is based on.

As Supernotes is growing, we wanted a font that would grow us and support different international languages as well in the future. Building a better font at the heart of a notetaking app seems like the best idea. At Supernotes we’ve built a custom text editor, based on an open source library we support, so why not do the same for a font.

Designed at [Supernotes](https://supernotes.app). Based on [Nunito](https://github.com/googlefonts/nunito) by Vernon Adams.
